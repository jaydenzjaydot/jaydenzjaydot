👋 Hi, I'm Thabo Zwane, Data Analyst (9+ years)  

  Welcome.......
I turn questions into insights and spreadsheets into stories. I take on fresh challenges every day, keep learning, and build tools that help teams make smarter decisions.

What I do
- I blend business sense with data skills to solve problems, improve processes, and tell clear stories from noisy data.
- I enjoy digging into messy datasets, automating repetitive work, and creating dashboards people actually use.

Key strengths
- Excel wizardry — advanced formulas, pivot tables, VBA-aware workflows
- Python for analysis — pandas, NumPy, visualization (matplotlib / seaborn), and automation
- SQL / MySQL — writing performant queries, data modeling, ETL basics
- Power BI — dashboards, DAX basics, and delivering actionable reports
- Curious, collaborative, and committed to continuous improvement

Career highlights
- 7+ years of hands-on analytics experience across cleaning, modeling, reporting, and stakeholder delivery.
- Regularly translate business needs into data solutions that reduce effort and increase clarity.
- Comfortable presenting findings to technical and non-technical audiences alike.

Tech toolbox
- Data wrangling: Excel, Python (pandas), SQL/MySQL
- Reporting & dashboards: Power BI, Excel dashboards
- Supporting tools: GitHub (version control and portfolio), Jupyter Notebooks
- Soft skills: problem decomposition, stakeholder communication, mentoring junior analysts

Projects & impact (examples to showcase in this repo)
- Sales performance dashboard — reduced weekly reporting time by 70% and surfaced top growth opportunities.
- Customer churn analysis — identified top churn drivers and recommended retention actions adopted by product teams.
- Automation scripts — migrated repetitive Excel workflows to reproducible Python scripts and scheduled jobs.

My learning path (what I'm focused on now)
- Strengthen Python skills for analysis and automation (bridging from Excel workflows)
- Deepen SQL & MySQL performance tuning and data modeling
- Expand Power BI mastery, DAX, and production-ready reporting patterns
- Solidify GitHub practices: versioning, notebooks, and sharable portfolios

If you're starting from Excel and feeling the same pinch I did transitioning to Python and SQL — keep going. Small, consistent practice with real problems (start with your own data) is the fastest route. Track what you build and share it — employers and collaborators love tangible examples.

How to find my best work in this profile
- Look for clear README for each project
- Run the notebook or sample dataset included
- Prioritize projects that show measurable impact (time saved, revenue uplift, improved decision-making)

- Check the Projects section in this repository — each project has a quick start and a one-line takeaway.

Thanks for visiting — if you're inspired to write your own README, start with: who you are, what you solve, the tools you use, and one proud result. Simple, honest, and focused on impact goes a long way.
